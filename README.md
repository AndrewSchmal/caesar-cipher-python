# caesar-cipher-python
This is a Python implementation of the Caesar cypher, which encrypts messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a set number of positions. This program lets you decode messages by specifying the number of spaces to shift. It's a great answer checker if you have any cyphers you want to check quickly.
